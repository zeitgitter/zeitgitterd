  default (1d), configurable via `--cache-control-static` or
  `ZEITGITTER_CACHE_CONTROL_STATIC`.

## Fixed

## Changed

# 1.1.1 - 2021-11-11

## Added

- Support for `favicon.ico` (served as `image/png`, as that is the most common
  type today)

## Fixed

- The fix for malformed request made things worse. Better fix.

## Changed

# 1.1.0 - 2021-11-11

## Added

- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` (and the ability to serve TXT and XML files)

## Fixed

- Be more defensive against malformed requests

## Changed

- Slightly changed explanatory web text and refreshed its appearance
- All text files now go through `ZEITGITTER_*` substitution

# 1.0.6 - 2021-11-04

## Added

## Fixed

## Changed

- Upgraded docker image to debian:bullseye-slim

# 1.0.5 - 2021-03-06

## Added

- Include an optional TLS termination proxy as part of the `docker-compose`
  setup (requires setting `ZEITGITTER_DOMAIN` in addition to
  `ZEITGITTER_OWN_URL` in `server.env`)

## Fixed

- Fixed Dockerfile for ARM64

## Changed

- Shrank docker image
- No changes to source or PyPI versions (except the version number); only Docker
  image is affected by the modifications leading up to v1.0.5

# 1.0.4 - 2021-03-05

## Added

- `--upstream-sleep` allows to sleep between upstream timestamps, e.g. to ensure
  a consistent ordering of cross-timestamping events for each commit.
- Time intervals (such as "5m3.5s") may skip the seconds indication, `s`. So
  `--upstream-sleep=0` is also valid.

## Fixed

## Changed

- Version numbers of non-tagged versions now end in `.postX`, where `X` is the
  number of commits since the tag (unless overridden by `FORCE_VERSION`
  environment variable).
- Docker image slightly smaller

# 1.0.3 - 2020-12-07

## Added

- More documentation: (especially in `doc/Docker.md`).
  - Setup and retirement of a timestamping server
  - Document choice/change of PGP key ID (and name)
- On restart, tries to resume waiting for a mail response from PGP Digital
  Timestamping Service (was added some versions ago, but never documented)
- New `tools/zeitgitter-repo-health.sh` allows to probe whether the repo has
  seen the expected updates. Optionally, skip fetches or test for specific files
  to have been modified and return a specific exit code. This is independent
  from the Docker health checks and can be run on a monitoring machine.
- Timespans may also indicate the number of weeks now (e.g., "1w 2d 8h 40m
  3.5s")
- Simplified using multiple cross-timestampers:
  - Add support to push all branches using `--push_branch=*`, saving the need to
    list/update them all (see also _Changes_ below)
  - `--upstream-timestamp` no longer needs a branch name, if `git timestamp`
    will determine it correctly. This leads to much shorter and more
    maintainable lists of cross-timestamping servers (e.g.,
    `gitta diversity some.other.server`).

## Fixed

- Code typo on failed key creation
- Docker health check failed due to missing `wget` package
- Docker health check now supports multiple cross-timestamping targets
- Tests test against new commit string (and, therefore, signatures) now

## Changed

- Docker image is now based on `debian:buster-slim`. As the same number of
  packages (171) has to be added on top of it, starting with the smaller image
  is preferable. (See [#0.9.6---2020-08-13](v0.9.6 below) for why not using one
  of the `python` base images.)
- Default for `--push-branch` is now `*`, meaning `--all` (which cannot be
  expressed in the config file)
- `ZEITGITTER_FAKE_TIME` (needed only for tests) is removed from the environment
  of `git timestamp` clients that connect to cross-timestamping servers
  specified as server name only (as opposed to `branch=server` tuples) to allow
  both testing against our local timeserver (which does not use wall clock to
  achieve reproducible signatures) and against real-world timeservers obeying
  wall clock.

# 1.0.2 - 2020-08-15

## Added

- Allow testing docker images without having to publish to PyPI and DockerHub.
  This will allow better testing in the future before releasing. (If you wonder
  why this Changelog does not say anything about v1.0.1, this is why.)

## Fixed

- Data loss can occur (and did in fact occur on `gitta.zeitgitter.net`) if `git`
  is not installed, due to `FileNotFoundError` signalling both harmless events
  (whether a file tested for presence exists) and important events (`git` cannot
  be executed, as it cannot be found). This resulted in destructive file
  operations being performed, as it was wrongly believed that the data was
  already recorded persistently in `git`. This has been fixed. :warning: Please
  refrain from using Docker image versions 1.0.0 or 0.9.6, and do update to
  1.0.1 also for non-Docker instances, as they will fail more harmlessly (i.e.,
  just lengthen the interval until `git` is present (again), resulting in
  precision loss from cross-timestamping, instead of with data loss).
- `git` included in Docker image
- Recovering from dangling repositories

## Changed

- A commit will be created after creating the timestamping repository and adding
  `pubkey.asc` to it, so that cross-timestamping can start then. Otherwise,
  cross-timestamping would result in error messages until the first external
  timestamping request arrives.

# 1.0.0 - 2020-08-13

## Added

## Fixed

## Changed

- Releasing 0.9.6 as 1.0.0

# 0.9.6 - 2020-08-13

## Added

## Fixed

## Changed

- Commit/tag message now starts with :watch:; this is not only useful for
  projects following [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) style, but also
  for visually distinguishing timestamps from regular commits/tags
- Base Docker image on `debian:buster`, as
  [`python:*` is on purpose not meant to be used with local system packages](https://github.com/docker-library/python/issues/482).
  However, `pygit2` is impractical to install without relying on system
  packages.

# 0.9.5 - 2020-05-13

## Added

- README for the Docker file
- Support for ARM and ARM64 docker images
- Documented support for multiple debug classes

## Fixed

- Web files again included in wheel
- `async_email_timestamp()` now really waits in a new thread for the mail reply

## Changed

- Reduced logging for PGP Timestamping Server mail handling
- Updated gnupg config documentation
- Newer GnuPG versions seem to ignore the symlink trick, now copying for real
- Restarting the server tries to resume a pending `async_email_timestamp()`
  waiting for the reply mail

# 0.9.4 - 2020-05-09

## Added

- Support for data in binary packages

## Fixed

## Changed

- Default port is now 15177 (as has been for systemd); tests use 15178
- Default debug level is now INFO. Numeric debug levels are now deprecated.
- Default commit interval has been set to 1h
- Simplified Docker setup/usage. Now created from pypi images.
- Docker is now the recommended usage platform.

# 0.9.3 - 2020-05-08

## Added

- Allow dots in tag names, as long as they are not next to each other (i.e.,
  `..` is not allowed)
- Added support for
  [PGP Digital Timestamping Service](http://www.itconsult.co.uk/stamper.htm) and
  improved documentation
- Timestamp our commit id as well with PGP Timestamper
- Configuration now easier: Just look for `EASYCONFIG` in `zeitgitter.conf`
- Added support for (semi-)automatic configuration
- Configuration through environment variables
- Support Docker
- More detailed debug support (see `--debug-level`)
- Minimal support for HTTP `HEAD` requests
- Can use IMAP servers without `IDLE` support (are there still any out there?)
- Work around a bug in some(?) Dovecot mail servers which cannot match the last
  character of a mail domain. I.e., `mailer@itconsult.co.uk` does not match the
  `From: Stamper <mailer@itconsult.co.uk>` header in IMAP SEARCH, but
  `mailer@itconsult.co.u` (note the missing `k`!) does match the header. This
  can be turned off via `--no-dovecot-bug-workaround`.

## Fixed

- Correctly handles IMAP `IDLE` responses other than `EXISTS` (especially
  Dovecot's `* OK still here`)
- End line in stamper mails may now also be in last line.
- Not receiving a stamper mail in time does no longer raise an exception

## Changed

- Split into client (git-timestamp) and server (zeitgitterd).
- Calculate a default for `--gnupg-home` to allow `--number-of-gpg-agents` > 1
- Commit log message includes timestamp as well to improve readability for
  `git blame` etc.
- Log message timestamps (including "Found uncommitted data") now say "UTC"
- Renamed all PGP Digital Timestamper related parameters to a common
  `--stamper-` prefix (the old names are still accepted, but deprecated)
- Mail tests now include a (local) configuration file for the site secrets.
- Maintainer affiliation
- Release on PyPI

# 0.9.2 - 2019-05-10

## Added

- `make apt` installs dependencies on systems supporting `apt`

### Client

- Distributable via PyPI
- Added Python 2.x compatibility; tested with 2.7
- Automatically derive default timestamp branch name from servername (first
  component not named 'igitt') followd by '-timestamps'.
- Better error message when wrong `gnupg` module has been installed

## Fixed

### Client

- Fetch GnuPG key again if missing from keyring. This fixes unexpected behavior
  when running as sudo vs. natively as root.
- Work around a bug in older GnuPG installs (create `pubring.kbx` if it does not
  yet exist before attempting `scan_keys()`).

## Changed

- Higher-level README

### Client

- Is now implemented as a package (`make install` still installs a flat file
  though, for simplicity)

# 0.9.1 - 2019-04-19

## Added

### Client

- `--server` can be set in git config
- Prevent actual duplicate entries created by `git timestamp --branch`
- Documented that `git timestamp --help` does not work and to use `-h`, as
  `--help` is swallowed by `git` and not forwarded to `git-timestamp`.
- Client system tests (require Internet connectivity)

### Server

- Ability to run multiple GnuPG processes (including gpg-agents) in parallel
- Handle missing `--push-repository` (again)

## Fixed

- Made tests compatible with older GnuPG versions

## Changed

### Client

- Made some error messages more consistent
- `--tag` overrides `--branch`. This allows to store a default branch in
  `git config`, yet timestamp a tag when necessary.

# 0.9.0 - 2019-04-04

Initial public release
